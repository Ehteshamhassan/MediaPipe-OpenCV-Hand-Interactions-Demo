# MediaPipe-OpenCV-Hand-Interactions-Demo
A Python CV project using OpenCV &amp; MediaPipe for real-time Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Developed a hand-controlled game (e.g., bouncing ball) that maps the 21-point hand model to game controls. Integrated dynamic visual filters that react to hand gestures. Demonstrates expertise in real-time tracking and AR-like overlays.
